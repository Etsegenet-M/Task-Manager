## Description
- This project was completed using tools such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript to create the Task List application. 
- Through this application the user can easily list their tasks and manage their status by selecting our "mark as done" button or deleting the tasks when completed.
 ## Features

## How to install
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `npm install`.

## How to use the product
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://task-list-final-project.netlify.app/`.
2. Use the interface to add a new task with a name of the task, description, assigned person, due date and use the *Add Task* button.
3. Use the *Mark as Done* button which changes the the 'Todo' to 'Done'.
4. And use the *Delete* button tasks.

## How to use Task Manager:
To use the task manager is very simple.

1. The first text field is for names of tasks that you need implemented (e.g. Wash the dishes).

2. The second text field is for the description of the task added. This description can be as descriptive or brief as you make it so use it to your own discretion.

3. The final two fields of input are for who the task will be designated to and the date they need to complete it by. All tasks are marked as "TODO" until they are either completed or deleted from the task manager. Once complete with a task, Please remember to delete afterwards as to not make up so much clutter.
